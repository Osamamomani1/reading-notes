# Structure in web pages :

 ### Many web pages act like electronic versions of documents


In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping 
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey 
and to navigate around the document

# Html5 Layout : 
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the 
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content 
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not 
stopped many web page authors using them already

![<div](https://images1.programmersought.com/9/86/862f310b81e2df0e77b469e6dac67829.png)

**as you can see its amke it easyer contoll how you want your structure to look like** 

For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group 
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a 
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes 
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

# Extra Markup
Since the web was first created, there have 
been several different versions of HTML.

Each new version was designed 
to be an improvement on the 
last (with new elements and 
attributes added and older code 
removed).


There have also been several versions of each browser used to 
view web pages, each of which implements new code. Not all 
web users, however, have the latest browsers installed on 
their computers, which means that not everyone will be able to 
view all of the latest features and markup.


Where you should be 
particularly aware of browsers 
not supporting certain features, 
I have made a note of this (as 
you have seen with some of the 
HTML5 elements introduced in 
the Forms chapter â€” and as you 
will see in the CSS chapters).
