## Dynamic web pages with JavaScript
![github](https://p92.com/binaries/content/gallery/p92website/technologies/htmlcssjs-details.png)
This is where we can change
how the page behaves, adding
interactivity. We will aim to keep
as much of our JavaScript as
possible in separate files.

### JavaScript in the HTML

-You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
opening <script> and closing </script> tags 

-The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). 

 ### it is better to put scripts in their own files for JavaScript 
 Keeping it separate means
that the page still works if the
user cannot load or run the
JavaScript. 

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

* STATEMENTS

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

* COMMENTS 

You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code. 

## Variables 

A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables. 

width x height = area

### DATA TYPES

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as a BOOLEAN




* NUMERIC DATA TYPE : 0.75 
* STRING DATA TYPE  : 'H.i, Ivy!'
* BOOLEAN DATA TYPE : True 

** you can use variables to store STRING or BOOLEAN . **


### RULES FOR NAMING Variables

**1)The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a numbe**

**2)The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.**

**3) You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.**

**4)All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.**

**5)Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.**

**6)If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).**
