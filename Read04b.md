### what makes a Computer , a Computer?
Any computer should perform four different tasks.
* take input
* store information
* processing
* give output

Computer take input from keybord , mause , camera , sensors ,....
then store information and processit then give you output like waht you see in your screen.

### How Computer work from inside  ?

Ones and zeros system called (Binary system) and its how computer see any type of data.

Inside Computer are electric wires and cicuts taht carry all teh information in a computer
and usuing electricity to represent information, how ?
* if you have a signal wire with electricity flowing on it the signal would be ON "1"
* if you have no electricity on it the signal would be OFF"0"

this on/off state of a signal wire is called a bit , and its the smallest pirce of information computer can store.

** the more bits computer have the more complex information computer can represent**

Computer can use bits with binary system to represent any kind of data like numbers , images , tesxt, sounds, videos ...

### Circuits and logic

Input and Iutput are binary information for a computer ( on/off) , and the computer needs to modify and combain the input signals , to do this computer use milions of teeny electronic components witch make a Circuits

what dose Circuits dose ? 
for example NOT Circuit take on or off signal and flips it 

you can add those Circuit toguther to get more complex Circuit witch can take multiple signals and combain them to goive a different result

and thats how processing work

### Computer parts

First we have an input devices like keybord , mause , mic , camira  ....
Then we have Memory to store information from input devices 
Then we have Center Proccesing Unit ( CPU ) to procces these informotion come form memory.
And finally we have output devices  like scrfeen headset ....

### Hardware And Software

* Hardware : Circuits , chips ,wires , speakers ,  plugs , stuff and you can see them inside the computer.

* Software is all of computer programs , or codes , running on the machine
