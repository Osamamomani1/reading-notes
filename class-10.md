## JavaScript (Error Handling & Debugging)



**When you are writing JavaScript, do not expect to write it perfectly the first time. 
Programming is like problem solving: you are given a puzzle and not only do you have to solve 
it, but you also need to create the instructions that allow the computer to solve it. too.**

When writing a long script, nobody gets everything right in their first attempt. The error 
messages that a browser gives look cryptic at first, but they can help you determine what 
went wrong in your JavaScript and how to fix it. In this chapter you will learn about: 
```

* If you understand execution contexts (which have two 
stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error 
in your code. 

* Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a 
process of deduction. 

* The console helps narrow down the area in which the 
error is located, so you can try to find the exact error. 

* JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates 
its own error object, which can tell you its line number 
and gives a description of the error. 

* If you know that you may get an error, you can handle 
it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
