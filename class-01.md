# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## HTML 

### structure :

![structer](https://www.jaimebutler.ch/jb-edit/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Basic-HTML.png)

* HTML pages are text documents .

* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled 
brackets) to give the information they surround special 
meaning.

* Tags are often referred to as elements.

* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end, **we use <_> as an opining tag and </_> as a close tag** .

* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more 
about the content of that element.

* Attributes require a name and a value.

* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are 
available for you to use, what they do, and where they 
can go.


### Extra Markup :

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you 
are using.

* You can add comments to your code between the markers <! -- and -->).

* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

* The < div > and < span > elements allow you to group 
block-level and inline elements together.
  
* < iframes > cut windows into your web pages through 
which other pages can be displayed.
  
* The < meta > tag allows you to supply all kinds of 
information about your web page.
 
* Escape characters are used to include special 
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©

### HTML5 Layout :

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of 
different parts of a web page and help to describe 
its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code (compared 
with using multiple < div > elements).
  
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 
elements need to be told which elements are 
block-level elements.

* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, 
which is available free from Google


### Process & Design :

![wirframe](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2015/12/wireframe-example-1.jpg)

* It's important to understand who your target audience 
is, why they would come to your site, what information 
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that 
will need to go on each page.
 
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps 
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

* You can differentiate between pieces of information 
using size, color, and style. 

* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify 
the information you present.

## JavaScript 

**The ABC of programming**

![ABC](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Fn-6bJEHL._SY445_SX342_QL70_ML2_.jpg)

1- A : what is a script and how do i creat ?

* A script is a series of instructions that computer can folow in order to achive a goal .
* Each time the script runs , It might be only use a subset of all the instructions.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

2- B : how computers fit in with the world around them?

* Computers creat models of the world using data.
* The models use objects to represent physicalthins ,objects can have : prperties that tell us about the object;
* methods that preform tasks usuing the prperties of the object; events wich are triggered when users interacts with the computer.
* Programmers can write code to say "When this event occurs,run the code".
* Web browsers use HTML markup to creat modle of the web page. Each element creates its own node (which is a kind of object).
* To make web pages interactive, you write code that use browser's model of the web page.

3- C : how do i write a script for a web bage ?

* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
* The HTML < script > element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rether like the < link > element can be used to load a CSS file).
* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
