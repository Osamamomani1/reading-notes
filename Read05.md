# Comparison Operators

### Evaluating Conditions
Note: The value of comparing is Bolean .

* **Is equal to** ( == ) : this Operator compares two values ( numbers , sreing , bolian) to see if they are the same .


* **Is not equal to** ( !== ) : this Operator compares two values ( numbers , sreing , bolian) to see if they are **NOT** the same .


* **Strict equal to** ( === ) : this Operator compares two values to check that bot value and data type are the same .


* **Strict not equal to** (!=== ) : this Operator compares two values to check that bot value and data type are **NOT** the same .


* ** Greater than ** ( > ) : this Operator check if the number on the left is greater than the number in the right .


* ** less than** ( < ) : this Operator check if the number on the left is less than the number in the right .


* **Greater than or equal to** ( >= ): this Operator check if the number on the left is greater  than **or equal** the number in the right


* ** Less than or equal to** ( <= ) : this Operator check if the number on the left is less than **or equal** the number in the right .


###  Logical Condition 

* ** logical and ** (&&) : this operator tist more than one condition , if both conditions are true then the answer is True else falls

*  **logical or ** (||) : this operator tist at least one condition and its alwas give a true unless both conditions are false .

*  **Logical not ** (!) : Invurse the main value if its true give false and if its false give a true .


## LOOPS 

* **For loop** : if you need run code specific number of time , use for loop .
(its the msost comen loop) 
in a for loop , the condition is usually a counter witch is used to tell how how amny times the loop should run .


* **While loop** : if you dont know how many times  the code should run , you can use  a While loop .
Here the condition can be something other than the counter , and the code wil continue to loo for as long as teh condition is a true 

* ** Do while loop** : the do  while loop is very similer to while loop , but have one key difference : it will alwas run the statments inside the curly braces at least once , even if condtion Evaluates to false
