## HTML & CSSS

### TEXT :

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of 
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

1- Headings :
HTML has six "levels" of 
headings from h1 to h6

2- Paragraphs : To create a paragraph, surround 
the words that make up the 
paragraph with an opening < p >
tag and closing < /p > tag

3- Bold & Italic : Line Breaks & 
Horizontal Rules

* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where 
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any 
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)


### Introducing CSS

![example of CSS ](https://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/webdesign/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2018/02/5.01_DW-W_Styles-1024x553.jpg)

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look.

* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like).

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements.

* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, 
although they may appear within an HTML page

## Basic javascript instructions

* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe. 

* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, 
you might specify that a value must be remembered 
before creating a calculation using that value. 

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of 
information used in the script. 

* Arrays are special types of variables that store more 
than one piece of related information. 

* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

* Expressions evaluate into a single value. 

* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 

## Decisions and Loops

* Conditional statements allow your code to make 
decisions about what to do next. 

* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) 
are used to compare two operands. 

* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one 
set of comparison operators. 

* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code 
if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 

* switch statements allow you to compare a value 
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default 
option if none match).
